🚀 Ready for Frontend Integration
The backend is now ready to serve the frontend pages you requested:
/register - Uses POST /api/auth/register
/login - Uses POST /api/auth/login
/dashboard - Uses GET /api/nurses/nearby
/requests - Uses POST /api/requests and GET /api/requests
/admin - Uses GET /api/admin/pending-nurses and PATCH /api/nurses/:id/verify
The backend server is currently running on http://localhost:3001 and all endpoints are functional. You can now proceed with frontend development or test the API endpoints using the provided documentation and test scripts.
Would you like me to help you with anything specific about the backend implementation or move on to frontend development?
